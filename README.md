- Live site: [darbecker12.github.io/cpnt260-final-project](https://darbecker12.github.io/cpnt260-final-project/)
- GitHub Project: [github.com/users/darbecker12/projects/6/](https://github.com/users/darbecker12/projects/6/)
- One keywords that helped us with gallery/shop page design was `css grid gallery`. [CSS-Trick Grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) was really helpful.
- Few keywords that helped us with hamburger menu were `js hamburger menu`, `css hamburger menu` and `html hamburger menu`. [w3School mobile navigation menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp) page gave some idea about how to do hamburger menu.
